          Framework for IP Addressing with References (IPREF)
               draft-augustyn-intarea-ipref-framework-00

Abstract

   This document describes IP addressing with references (referred to as
   IPREF) and how it can be used with IPv4 and IPv6.  IPREF is a
   private-to-private technology where hosts on private networks
   communicate with hosts on other private networks directly.  Special
   addresses, called IPREF addresses, are used for the purpose.  It also
   describes how hosts on private networks may publish their IPREF
   addresses via Domain Name System (DNS).

1.  Introduction

   Normally, hosts on private networks are only reachable by other hosts
   on the same private networks.  To make them visible to other hosts,
   techniques like NAT, popular with IPv4 private networks, or
   filtering, more likely found with IPv6 private networks, are used to
   make them appear on the public Internet.  In most cases, only
   selected services, determined by their layer 4 port numbers, are made

   available through these methods.  Services from different private
   hosts may share a single public address.

   This document describes a different way of accessing hosts on private
   networks.  It is done by enhancing capabilities of existing layer 3
   protocols.  The enhancement provides for addressing with references
   where the source and destination is specified by means of references
   rather than concrete addresses.  The respective private networks,
   communicating in this manner, use these references to render actual
   addresses on their local networks.  Reference are single values,
   unsigned integers, which are carried in addition to the existing
   addresses by the layer 3 protocols.

   In theory, any layer 3 protocol can operate in the manner described.
   For practical purpose, this document discusses only the case of IPv4
   and IPv6, and only with the Internet connecting communicating private
   networks.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  IPREF Terminology

   IPREF - short name referring to the technology described in this
   document, pronounced I-P-REF

   _third_ network - network connecting communicating private networks,
   e.g.: the Internet

   _encoding_ network - network representing hosts on peer private
   network

2.  Overview

   IP addressing with references (IPREF) is intended for communication
   between private networks connected via a _third_ network, typically
   the Internet.  The references are opaque integers that factor in
   calculating of actual addresses at the respective private networks.
   References are not direct IP addresses.  Each private network makes
   their calculations independently irrespective of how their peers
   might be interpreting the same references.  The resulting addresses
   are normally different (they may be the same by chance) and are not
   known to the peers.

   IPREF deals with private networks, there is no intention to
   communicate directly with 'public' hosts, i.e. hosts with addresses
   on the _third_ network.  There is no need to.  These 'public' hosts
   normally reside on private networks anyway.  They are made available
   on the 'public' network using techniques such as NAT (Network Address
   Translation) or filtering.  Since they reside on private networks,
   they can be reached through IPREF directly without NAT mapping or
   creating special filters.

   In case of IPv6 private networks, local addresses may be globally
   routable.  In spite of that, they may or may not be reachable from
   peer private networks.  IPREF is not concerned with that, it works
   the same way regardless.  Similarly, IPv4 private networks may
   include hosts with globally routable addresses, it makes no
   difference.  Peer networks still don't know, and don't need to know,
   what those addresses are and to which protocol they belong.

   IPREF is a form of network address translation but it is never
   referred to it by this term to avoid confusion with well known NAT.
   It is always referred to as IPREF.  It is an evolution of address
   rewriting technology.

2.1.  IPREF Addresses

   The references are used in conjunction with standard IP addresses
   from the third network.  These are typically addresses of gateway
   interfaces where the packets arrive at or where they are being sent
   from.  A combination of a _third_ network IP address and the
   reference is called an IPREF address, Figure 1.

                          Figure 1: IPREF address

   In the notation, a plus sign '+' is used to separate the IP address
   from the reference.  In a packet exchange, there is a source IPREF
   address and a destination IPREF address, thus two references.  The
   destination reference is allocated by the destination private network
   while the source reference is allocated by the source private
   network.  There are no negotiations.  Each peer defines their own
   references and accept peer references as opaque values.

2.2.  Packet Exchange

   Figure 2 depicts how two local networks communicate with one another.
   Local network A has two standard hosts A5, A7, and a gateway GWA.
   The gateway connects to the _third_ network, the Internet.  Local
   network B has hosts B4, B6, and a gateway GWB.  The gateway connects
   to the same _third_ network as gateway GWA.  Only the gateways are
   aware of, and implement, IPREF processing.  The hosts on both local
   networks, as well as any networks hosts, routers, or nodes on the
   _third_ network are standard network devices, unaware of IPREF.  For
   simplicity, the examples shows the case of IPv4 running on all three
   networks.  The IP addresses on local networks may overlap but for
   simplicity are shown as distinct.  Further, for ease of following the
   example, addresses related to local network A are odd while addresses
   related to local network B are even.

   Hosts on local network A communicate with hosts on other local
   networks, such as local network B, without knowing the IP addresses
   on the peer network or even without knowing the network protocol
   employed by the peer network.  An _encoding_ network is used in lieu
   of the peer private network addresses.  The peer hosts appear as if
   they were hosted on the _encoding_ network.  This is a compatibility
   feature.  It is possible to avoid such mapping at the cost of making
   local hosts IPREF aware.  That case is not described here as it is
   dramatically simpler to use _encoding_ networks and leave existing
   hosts as-is without any modifications.

                      Figure 2: private networks

   Let's assume host A5 wants to send a packet to host B4 and receive a
   response.  Prior to the packet exchange, an administrator from local
   network B informs an administrator of local network A that host B can
   be reached at an IPREF address 198.151.100.22+400.  Local
   administrator enters that information on gateway GWA which in turn
   allocates an _encoded_ address of 10.128.0.40 to represent host B.
   This information is further passed to host A5 so that it can send
   packets to host B by using 10.128.0.40 as the destination.

   In step (1) host A5 places its own address as source, 172.17.1.75 and
   the provided address of host B 10.128.0.40 as destination.  As the
   packet traverses the network, both source and destination addresses
   will be rewritten.  It is illustrated in Figure 3.  In step (2), the
   packet arrives at gateway GWA.  The gateway realizes the destination
   is an _encoded_ address.  It finds that the address corresponds to an
   IPREF address 198.51.100.22+400.  It places this IPREF address in the
   packet as the new destination address.  It also finds that the source
   address 172.17.1.75 does not correspond to any IPREF address so it
   allocates one through some algorithm, perhaps randomly, as
   198.51.100.11+500.  It places this IPREF address in the packet as the
   new source address.  It then sends the packet into the _third_
   network.  This is the common network, the Internet, that both local

   networks A and B connect to.  In step (3) the packet arrives at
   gateway GWB.  The gateway recognizes the destination IPREF address as
   representation of the internal host's B address 172.18.2.64.  It
   places this address in the packet as new destination address.  The
   gateway does not recognize the source IPREF address so it allocates
   an _encoded_ address for it 10.192.0.70.  It places this address in
   the packet as the new source address.  It, then, sends the packet to
   the local host B4.  In step (4), local host B4 receives the packet
   and recognizes the destination address as its own.  It consumes the
   packet and processes it according to the payload.

  Host B4 has IPREF address: 198.51.100.22+400
          encoded at GWA as: 10.128.0.40

  Host A5 is allocated IPREF address: 198.51.100.11+500
                   encoded at GWB as: 10.192.0.70

   In step (5), host B4 sends a response back to host A5.  I reverses
   source and destination addresses and sends a packet to gateway GWB.
   In step (6), the packet arrives at gateway GWB.  The gateway
   recognizes the destination address as an _encoded_ address previously
   created to represent IPREF address 198.51.100.11+500.  It places this
   IPREF address in the packet as the new destination address.  The
   gateway also recognizes the source address as corresponding to a
   preset IPREF address 198.51.100.22+400.  It places this IPREF address
   as the new source address.  It then sends the packet to the _third_
   network.  In step (7), the packet arrives at gateway GWA.  The
   gateway recognizes the destination IPREF address as corresponding to
   the local host A5 172.17.1.75.  It places this address in the packet
   as the new destination address.  It also recognizes the source IPREF
   address as one represented by an _encoded_ address 10.128.0.40.  It
   places that address in the packet as the new source address.  It then
   sends the packet to the local host A5. in step (8), local host A5
   recognizes the destination address 172.17.1.75 as its own and
   consumes the packet for processing.  This concludes packet exchange.

   In general case, networks may have overlapping addresses, they may
   have several local subnets, they may have more than one gateway to
   the _third_ network.  They may also run different network protocols.
   For example one private network may run IPv4 while its peer may run
   IPv6.  The communicating networks do not need to know their peers'
   actual IP addresses or network protocols.  The references are the
   stand ins representing those addresses in their native network
   protocol domains.  The references are interpreted independently by
   both communicating networks.  In the example above, network B
   allocates reference '400' to represent host B4.  At network B, that
   reference is interpreted as 172.18.2.64 whereas that same reference
   is interpreted as 10.128.0.4 at network A.  Neither network knows, or
   cares about, how the references are interpreted outside of their own
   administrative domains.  In cases where interpretation involves
   changing network protocol, the local gateway must run dual stacks and
   perform proper repackaging of the packets.  Of course, higher level
   protocol, such as TCP/UDP, must be compatible for this to be
   practical.  IPv4 and IPv6 meet this criterion.

2.3.  DNS with IPREF

   Similarly to standard IP, IPREF can operate without DNS (Domain Name
   System) relying on IPREF addresses manually entered and distributed.
   For example, an /etc/hosts file could be used for the purpose.  Such
   use makes sense in certain cases and is available with IPREF the same
   way as it is with standard IP.  Especially on private networks, the
   practice of using direct addresses is common even if local domain
   names are allocated to the hosts.

   IPREF can take full advantage of DNS.  IPREF addresses are
   publishable.  When resolving names that render IPREF addresses, local
   resolvers must obtain translation into _encoded_ addresses for
   standard hosts on local networks.  This is the normal case, only
   IPREF gateways understand IPREF addresses, the vast majority of hosts
   are standard hosts which are unaware of IPREF addressing.  The
   necessary mapping to _encoded_ addresses is typically made by IPREF
   gateways and presented back to resolvers which pass them to the
   querying hosts.  In addition, IPREF gateways must be aware of all
   local hosts whose IPREF addresses are published through DNS.  This is
   illustrated in Figure 4.

                          Figure 4: DNS with IPREF

   Local hosts A5 and A7 resolve DNS names via a local resolver.  The
   resolver queries DNS servers on their behalf.  A query may return a
   standard IPv4 or IPv6 address, or it may return an IPREF address.  In
   the former cases, the IP addresses are simply returned to the
   querying hosts.  In case of IPREF addresses, the resolvers consults
   related IPREF gateway for a mapping to an _encoded_ network.  The
   gateway may allocate one on the fly if mapping is not available.  The
   resulting _encoded_ IP address is then returned to the querying
   hosts.

   Local network administrator may decide to publish IPREF addresses of
   some internal hosts via DNS.  The IPREF gateway must be aware which
   hosts are made available externally and what IPREF address have been
   assigned to them.  Typically, this is a semi-static configuration
   which remains stable for long periods of time.  The gateways may
   query those DNS servers for information periodically or some other
   mechanism may be employed to pass that information to the IPREF
   gateways.

   Returning to the packet exchange scenario shown in Figure 3, the
   IPREF address of host B4 may be published via a public DNS server
   maintained by the administrator of local network B.  In that case,
   host A5 may simply use a DNS name of that host and ask local resolver
   to provide the corresponding IP address.  The resolver would query
   the DNS server, recognize the response as an IPREF address and
   consult local IPREF gateway for proper mapping to an _encoded_ IP
   address.  That IP address would then be returned to host A5 which in
   turn would use it as the destination IP address.

5.  Embedding References in IP Packets

   A reference is a network layer entity and the most natural place for
   embedding it would be a network layer header, such as an IPv4 option
   or an IPv6 extension header.

   Unfortunately, many Internet Service Providers drop options and
   extensions headers that they deem not worthy processing.  Even if
   they don't, network devices tend to put them on a slow processing
   path resulting in poor performance.  For that reason, the most
   reliable way to embed references is to place them in the payload.
   One such common technique is tunneling where a reference could be
   placed in the payload along with the network packet being tunneled.

5.1.  IPv4 Option

   With IPv4, references may be embedded in an IPv4 header option.  It
   would be a new option type.  It would contain an octet with option
   type and option number, an octet with length, and two octets reserved
   for possible future use while padding to four octet boundary.  The
   source and destination references would then follow.

   A new option number would be registered with IANA.  Until then,
   experimental option, 30, could be used.  A separate document should
   describe it in detail.

5.2.  IPv6 Extension Header

   With IPv6, references may be embedded in an IPv6 extension header.
   It would be a new header type.  It would contain an octet with next
   header type value, an octet with length, and two octets reserved for
   possible future use.  This would be followed by four octets of
   padding to 8 octet boundary.  Padding octets would not be intended
   for any future use.  The source and destination references would then
   follow.

   A new protocol type would be registered with IANA.  Until then,
   experimental protocol, 254, could be used.  A separate document
   should describe it in detail.

5.3.  UDP Tunnel

   Placing references in a UDP tunnel works for both IPv4 and IPv6.  In
   both cases, the references are embedded in the form of respective
   option or extension header.  In addition, a tunnel encapsulation
   record is added.  The order of items is as follows:

      UDP header
      Tunnel encapsulation record
      IPREF option
      Packet payload

   The encapsulation record would consist of four octets.  First octet
   would contain the value of TTL copied from the original IP header.
   The second octet would contain protocol number copied from the
   original IPv4 header or next header value form an IPv6 extension
   header.  The third octet would report number of hops detected for
   incoming packets.  The fourth octet would be reserved for possible
   future use while padding to 4 octet boundary.  The IPREF option would
   follow in the format matching respective IP protocol, IPv4 or IPv6.

   The tunnel would operate at port 1045.  This value would be
   registered with IANA.  A separate document should describe the tunnel
   in detail.
