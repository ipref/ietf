    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes IP addressing with references (referred to as IPREF) and how it
        can be used with IPv4 and IPv6. It uses special addresses called IPREF addresses which
        use references to IP addresses instead of actual addresses. IPREF provides highly scalable
        means of traversing private address spaces end-to-end. It can traverse private address
        spaces both within the same protocol domain and across protocol domains. For example, it
        allows NAT traversal for IPv4, or for IPv6 with NAT6 or filters. It also allows direct
        communication between IPv4 and IPv6 networks, including over NAT, NAT6, or filters.
      </t>
      <t>IPREF addresses are publishable via Domain Name System (DNS). Any host on any private
        network may publish its services via DNS. These services are reachable from any network,
        whether IPv4 or IPv6, provided IPREF is supported on both ends.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Normally, hosts on private networks are only reachable by other hosts on the same private networks. To
         make them visible to hosts on other networks, techniques such as Network Address Translation (NAT),
         popular with IPv4 private networks, or filtering, more likely found with IPv6 private networks, are
         used to make them appear on the public Internet. In most cases, only selected services, determined by
         their layer 4 port numbers, are made available through these methods. Services from different private
         hosts may share a single public address.
      </t>
      <t>This document describes a different way of accessing hosts on private networks. It is done by enhancing
         capabilities of existing layer 3 protocols. The enhancement provides for addressing with references where
         the source and destination is specified by means of references rather than concrete addresses. The respective
         private networks, communicating in this manner, use these references to render actual addresses on their
         local networks. Reference are single values, unsigned integers, which are carried in addition to the existing
         addresses by the layer 3 protocols.
      </t>
      <t>In theory, any layer 3 protocol can operate in the manner described. For practical purpose, this document
         discusses only the case of IPv4 and IPv6.

    <section><name>Overview</name>

      <t>IP addressing with references (IPREF) is intended for communication between private networks connected
        via a <em>third</em> network, typically the Internet. The references are opaque integers that factor
        in calculating of actual addresses at the respective private networks. References are not direct IP addresses.
        Each private network makes their calculations independently irrespective of how their peers might be interpreting
        the same references. The resulting addresses are normally different (they may be the same by chance) and
        are not known to the peers.
      </t>
      <t>IPREF deals with private networks, there is no intention to communicate directly with 'public' hosts, i.e.
        hosts with addresses on the <em>third</em> network. There is no need to. These 'public' hosts normally reside
        on private networks anyway. They are made available on the 'public' network using techniques such as NAT or
        filtering. Since they reside on private networks, they can be reached through IPREF directly without NAT mapping
        or creating special filters.
      </t>
      <t>In case of IPv6 private networks, local addresses may be globally routable. In spite of that,
        they may or may not be reachable from peer private networks. IPREF is not concerned with it, it
        works the same way regardless. Similarly, IPv4 private networks may include hosts with globally
        routable addresses, it's immaterial. With IPREF, peer networks still don't know, and don't need
        to know, what those addresses are and to which protocol they belong.
      </t>
      <t>IPREF is a form of network address translation but it is never referred to it by this term to
        avoid confusion with well known NAT. It is always referred to as IPREF. It is an evolution of
        address rewriting technology.
      </t>

      <section><name>IPREF Addresses</name>

        <t>The references are used in conjunction with standard IP addresses from the <em>third</em> network. These
          are typically addresses of gateway interfaces where the packets arrive at or where they are being sent
          from. A combination of a <em>third</em> network IP address and the reference is called an IPREF address,
          <xref target="ipref-address"/>.
        </t>

        <t>In the notation, a plus sign '+' is used to separate the IP address from the reference. In a packet exchange,
          there is a source IPREF address and a destination IPREF address, thus two references. The destination reference
          is allocated by the destination private network while the source reference is allocated by the source private
          network. There are no negotiations. Each peer defines their own references and accepts peer references as opaque
          values.

      <section><name>Traversing Address Spaces in the Same Protocol Domain</name>

        <t><xref target="private-networks-same-protocol"/> depicts how two local networks communicate
          with one another. Local network A has two standard hosts A5, A7, and a gateway GWA. The
          gateway connects to the <em>third</em> network, the Internet. Local network B has hosts
          B4, B6, and a gateway GWB. The gateway connects to the same <em>third</em> network as
          gateway GWA. Only the gateways are aware of, and implement, IPREF processing. The hosts
          on both local networks, as well as any hosts or routers on the <em>third</em> network are
          standard network devices, unaware of IPREF. For simplicity, the examples shows the case
          of IPv4 running on all three networks. The IP addresses on local networks may overlap but
          for simplicity are shown as distinct. Further, for ease of following the example, addresses
          related to local network A are odd while addresses related to local network B are even.
        </t>
        <t>Hosts on local network A communicate with hosts on other local networks, such as local network B, without
          knowing IP addresses on the peer networks or even without knowing network protocols employed by the
          peer networks. An <em>encoding</em> network is used in lieu of the peer private network addresses. The peer
          hosts appear as if they were hosted on the <em>encoding</em> network. This is a compatibility feature. It
          is possible to avoid such mapping at the cost of making local hosts IPREF aware. That case is not described
          here as it is dramatically simpler to use <em>encoding</em> networks and leave existing hosts as-is, without
          any modifications.

        <t>Let's assume host A5 wants to send a packet to host B4 and receive a response. Prior to the packet
          exchange, an administrator from local network B informs an administrator of local network A that host
          B can be reached at an IPREF address 198.151.100.22+400. Local administrator enters that information
          on gateway GWA which in turn allocates an <em>encoded</em> address of 10.128.0.40 to represent host B.
          This information is further passed to host A5 so that it can send packets to host B by using 10.128.0.40
          as the destination.
        </t>
        <t>In step (1) host A5 places its own address as source, 172.17.1.75 and the provided address of host B 10.128.0.40
          as destination. As the packet traverses the network, both source and destination addresses will be rewritten.
          It is illustrated in <xref target="address-rewriting"/>. In step (2), the packet arrives at gateway GWA. The gateway
          realizes the destination is an <em>encoded</em> address. It finds that the address corresponds to an IPREF address
          198.51.100.22+400. It places this IPREF address in the packet as the new destination address. It also finds that
          the source address 172.17.1.75 does not correspond to any IPREF address so it allocates one through some algorithm,
          perhaps randomly, as 198.51.100.11+500. It places this IPREF address in the packet as the new source address. It then
          sends the packet into the <em>third</em> network. This is the common network, the Internet, that both local networks
          A and B connect to. In step (3) the packet arrives at gateway GWB. The gateway recognizes the destination IPREF address
          as representation of the internal host's B address 172.18.2.64. It places this address in the packet as new destination
          address. The gateway does not recognize the source IPREF address so it allocates an <em>encoded</em> address for it
          10.192.0.70. It places this address in the packet as the new source address. It, then, sends the packet to the local
          host B4. In step (4), local host B4 receives the packet and recognizes the destination address as its own. It consumes
          the packet and processes it according to the payload.

        <t>In step (5), host B4 sends a response back to host A5. It reverses source and destination addresses and sends a
          packet to gateway GWB. In step (6), the packet arrives at gateway GWB. The gateway recognizes the destination address
          as an <em>encoded</em> address previously created to represent IPREF address 198.51.100.11+500. It places this IPREF
          address in the packet as the new destination address. The gateway also recognizes the source address as corresponding
          to a preset IPREF address 198.51.100.22+400. It places this IPREF address as the new source address. It then sends
          the packet to the <em>third</em> network. In step (7), the packet arrives at gateway GWA. The gateway recognizes the
          destination IPREF address as corresponding to the local host A5 172.17.1.75. It places this address in the packet
          as the new destination address. It also recognizes the source IPREF address as one represented by an <em>encoded</em>
          address 10.128.0.40. It places that address in the packet as the new source address. It then sends the packet to the
          local host A5. in step (8), local host A5 recognizes the destination address 172.17.1.75 as its own and consumes
          the packet for processing. This concludes packet exchange.
        </t>
        <t>In subsequent packet exchanges, all necessary mappings have been established. The gateways perform simple lookups
          without the need to make any additional allocations.
        </t>
        <t>In general case, networks may have overlapping addresses, they may have several local subnets, they may have more
          than one gateway to the <em>third</em> network. They may also run different network protocols. For example
          one private network may run IPv4 while its peer may run IPv6. The communicating networks do not need to know their
          peers' actual IP addresses or network protocols. The references are the stand ins representing those addresses in
          their native network protocol domains. The references are interpreted independently by both communicating networks.
          In the example above, network B allocates reference '400' to represent host B4. At network B, that reference is
          interpreted as 172.18.2.64 whereas that same reference is interpreted as 10.128.0.4 at network A. Neither network
          knows, or is concerned with, how the references are interpreted outside of their own administrative domains. In cases
          where interpretation involves changing network protocols, the local gateway must run dual stacks and perform proper
          repackaging of the payload. Of course, higher level protocols such as TCP/UDP, must be compatible for this to be
          practical.

        <t>Let's assume host A7 wants to communicate with host B2. The IPREF address of B2 can be
          obtain from DNS as 2001:db8:bb::2 + 4286. Local resolver realizes it's an IPREF address
          and asks local mapper to allocate an encoded address for it. Let's assume, the encoded
          address is 10.128.0.214. The addresses are rewritten as below. The first address is
          the source and the second address is the destination:
        </t>
        <ol>
          <li>at A7:  |  172.17.1.77  |  10.254.0.214  |  payload  |</li>
          <li>at GWA: |  2001:db8:aa::1 + 7935  |  2001:db8:bb::2 + 4286  |  payload  |</li>
          <li>at GWB: |  fdee:eeee::3b9e  |  2001:db8:bb:2::28  |  payload  |</li>
          <li>at B2:  |  fdee:eeee::3b9e  |  2001:db8:bb:2::28  |  payload  |</li>
        </ol>
        <t>Explanation. In step 1, A7 places its own address as the source. The destination is
          obtained via DNS with local resolver returning the encoded address of B2 as 10.254.0.214
          in lieu of the IPREF address 2001:db8:bb::2 + 4286. In step 2, GWA first recognizes
          that it has to convert the IPv4 packet to an IPv6 packet. It then deals with addresses
          in their respective protocol domains. It does not recognize the source IPv4 address
          so it allocates an IPREF address for it with an IPv6 native portion as 2001:db8:aa::1 + 7935.
          It finds the destination address 10.254.0.14 as corresponding to an IPREF address of
          2001:db8:bb::2 + 4286 that already has an IPv6 native portion so it can place it
          as destination without further conversions. In step 3, GWB does not recognize the
          source IPREF address, so  it allocates an encoded address for it fdee:eeee::3b9e.
          It recognizes the destination address as corresponding to the address of the local
          host b2 and places its local IP address of 2001:db8:bb:2::28. In step 4, local host
          recognizes the destination address as its own and consumes the packet.

        <t>Many organizations maintain large private networks with complex topologies managed by
          many administrators responsible for different parts of the network. In some cases,
          traffic from one internal network must go through another internal network, managed
          by a different administrator, before reaching the Internet. This creates a case, where
          an internal network is effectively nested inside another internal network.

        <t>In <xref target="nested-networks"/>, gateway GWB connects network B 172.18.2.0/24 directly

          directly. Traffic from network C must go through network B to reach the Internet. In terms of
          managing references, the administrator of network B can only allocate references to hosts
          on its own network. Anything destined to network C would be passed to gateway GWC unchanged.
          Network C must employ its own IPREF reference management and processing if it wants to

        <t>Nested networks pose no issues in terms of traversing address spaces but they have an
          impact on visibility of services published via IPREF. There are two cases. In one case,
          there are no services published via DNS on any host on the nested network. In the other
          case, there is at least one host that publishes services advertised via DNS.
        </t>
        <section><name>No services published via DNS</name>
          <t>Let's first consider a case where a nested network does not publish any services through
            IPREF advertised via DNS. Hosts on this network can still reach services published 
            elsewhere. For example, let's say host C3 wants to reach host A5 from a previous example
            above. In that case, the addresses would be translated as listed below. The first address
            is the source, and the second address is the destination:
          </t>
          <ol>
            <li>at C3:  |  172.19.9.39  |  10.254.0.45  |  payload  |</li>
            <li>at GWC: |  172.18.2.3 + 794  |  198.51.100.11 + 537  |  payload  |</li>
            <li>at GWB: |  198.51.100.22 + 486  |  198.51.100.11 + 537  |  payload  |</li>
            <li>at GWA: |  10.128.0.82  |  172.17.1.75  |  payload  |</li>
            <li>at A5:  |  10.128.0.82  |  172.17.1.75  |  payload  |</li>
          </ol>
          <t>Explanations and assumptions to the sequence above. In step 1, C3 uses its own internal
            address as source. The destination is assumed to be provided by network A in form of
            an IPREF address of 198.51.100.11 + 537. That IPREF address is encoded on network C as
            10.254.0.45. The encoding would be done by the GWC mapper upon learning A5's IPREF
            address (either manually or via DNS). In step 2, GWC does not recognize source address
            172.19.9.39, so it allocates an IPREF address to it 172.18.2.3 + 794. The native portion
            of the IPREF address is the outer address on the gateway as usual. It then looks up the
            encoded address of the destination as corresponding to 198.51.100.11 + 537. In step 3,
            GWB does not recognize the source IPREF address, so it allocates its own IPREF address
            as 198.51.100.22 + 486. The destination IPREF address remains unchanged. In step 4, GWA
            does not recognize source IPREF address, so it encodes it as 10.128.0.82. It recognizes
            the destination IPREF address as one representing local host A5 172.17.1.5. In step 5,
            destination host A5 recognizes the destination as its own and consumes the packet.
          </t>
          <t>There is one additional step in this sequence as compared to an earlier example. GWB
            performs additional IPREF mapping on a source that is already an IPREF address. Indeed,
            IPREF may perform several steps of that kind depending on the level of nesting of
            private networks. In theory, there is no limit to it. In practice, hop count determines
            how deeply this can go.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section><name>Services potentially published via IPREF</name>
          <t>If there were any services to be published via IPREF on network C, then GWC cannot use
            its outer IP address as the native portion of an IPREF address because that address is not
            visible on the Internet. This is strictly DNS publishing issues. Packets would reach
            relevant hosts regardless (because GWB would re-translate to an address with Internet
            visible native portion) but at a cost of a very complicated configuration that would need
            to be done in two places and kept in sync. This would be an impractical solution.
          </t>
          <t>A better approach is delegation. The gateway that directly connects to the Internet would
            delegate some of the references from its pool to nested gateways. That way nested gateways
            could allocate IPREF address with Internet visible native portion. This is only needed if
            there are any services hosted on the nested networks intended for publishing in DNS. The
            gateway that delegates its references, GWB in the example, knows which gateways the
            references were delegated to and thus it can forward incoming packets accordingly.
          </t>
          <t>Let's assume network C publishes a website on host C3. Let's also assume that GWB delegated
            references 6000 thru 8000 to gateway GWC. Now, gateway GWC allocates IPREF addresses with
            native portion equal to GWB's outer address and with references from the delegated range.
            Let's say it allocated IPREF address 198.51.100.22 + 6789 to the website hosted on C3. Now,
            host A7 can reach that website with addresses undergoing the following translations:
          </t>
          <ol>
            <li>at A7:  |  172.17.1.77  |  10.128.0.217  |  payload  |</li>
            <li>at GWA: |  198.51.100.11 + 591  |  198.51.100.22 + 6789  |  payload  |</li>
            <li>at GWB: |  198.51.100.11 + 591  |  172.18.2.3 + 6789  |  payload  |</li>
            <li>at GWC: |  10.254.7.221  |  172.19.9.39  |  payload  |</li>
            <li>at C3:  |  10.254.7.221  |  172.19.9.33  |  payload  |</li>
          </ol>
          <t>Explanation. Host A7 wants to reach a website hosted at C3. In step 1, A7 uses its own
            address as source. It uses an encoded address of 10.128.0.217 as destination. That encoded
            address was allocated by gateway GWA upon learning C3's IPREF address. In step 2, GWA
            does not recognize A7's address so it allocates an IPREF address 198.51.100.11 + 591
            to represent 172.17.1.77. In step 3, GWB recognizes the destination IPREF address as
            one from the range delegated to gateway GWC. In that case, it simply forwards it to GWC. 
            Since IPREF is strictly about addressing, it does not forward packets by itself. Rather,
            it relies on the underlying native network protocol to do so. It rewrites the destination
            IPREF address so that the native portion points to GWC. The local network protocol may
            now forward the packet to GWC. In step 4, GWC recognizes the destination IPREF address
            as its own. I also recognizes the reference as delegated from GWB, therefore it replaces
            the native portion of the IPREF address with the outer address of the gateway where the
            references were deleted from, i.e. GWB. It then looks up that IPREF address as corresponding
            to host C3. It allocates an encoding address to the source IPREF address as 10.254.7.221
            since this is the first time it sees that source IPREF address. In step 5, C3 recognizes
            destination address as its own and consumes the packet.

      <section><name>DNS with IPREF</name>

        <t>Similarly to standard IP, IPREF can operate with or without DNS. IPREF addresses may be entered and
          distributed manually. For example, an /etc/hosts file could be used for the purpose. Such use makes
          sense in certain cases. Especially on private networks, the practice of using direct addresses is
          common even if local DNS names are allocated to the hosts.
        </t>
        <t>IPREF can also take full advantage of DNS. IPREF addresses are publishable. When resolving names that
          render IPREF addresses, local resolvers must obtain translation into <em>encoded</em> addresses for
          standard hosts on local networks. This is the normal case, only IPREF gateways understand IPREF addresses,
          the vast majority of hosts are standard hosts which are unaware of IPREF. The necessary mapping
          to <em>encoded</em> addresses is typically made by IPREF gateways and presented back to resolvers which
          pass them to the querying hosts. In addition, IPREF gateways must be aware of all local hosts whose IPREF
          addresses are published through DNS. This is illustrated in <xref target="dns-with-ipref"/>.

        <t>Local hosts A5 and A7 resolve DNS names via a local resolver. The resolver queries DNS servers on their
           behalf. A query may return a standard IPv4 or IPv6 address, or it may return an IPREF address. In the
           former cases, the IP addresses are simply returned to the querying hosts. In case of IPREF addresses,
           the resolvers consults related IPREF gateway for a mapping to an <em>encoded</em> network. The gateway may
           allocate one on the fly if mapping is not available. The resulting <em>encoded</em> IP address is then
           returned to the querying hosts.
        </t>
        <t>Local network administrator may decide to publish IPREF addresses of some internal hosts via DNS. The
           IPREF gateway must be aware which hosts have been made available externally and what IPREF addresses
           have been assigned to them. Typically, this is a semi-static configuration which remains stable for long
           periods of time. The gateways may query those DNS servers for information periodically or some other
           mechanism may be employed to pass that information to the IPREF gateways.
        </t>
        <t>Returning to the packet exchange example shown in <xref target="address-rewriting"/>, the IPREF
           address of host B4 may be published via a public DNS server maintained by the administrator of local
           network B. In that case, host A5 may simply use a DNS name of that host and ask local resolver to provide
           the corresponding IP address. The resolver would query the DNS server, recognize the response as an
           IPREF address and consult local IPREF gateway for proper mapping to an <em>encoded</em> IP address.
           That IP address would then be returned to host A5 which in turn would use it as the destination IP
           address.

    </section>  <!-- ^^Overview^^ -->

    <section><name>IPREF Reference</name>

      <t>An IPREF reference is an unsigned integer 16 octets in size. Values 0-255 are reserved. Of the
        reserved values, only one is defined. The value of 0 indicates a null reference, i.e. a reference
        which is not subject to mapping, rather, it indicates the related IP address should be used directly.
      </t>
      <t>The registry of reserved reference values should be vested with IANA. For now, these values are
        listed here until a suitable request to establish such registry is made with IANA.
      </t>
      <t>References are meaningful only in the context of their local networks. Local administrators may
        divide them into fields for any purpose they deem useful. For example, the fields may reflect
        different sources of allocations, or provide extra security bits, or provide load balancing
        options, or provide A/B address ranges etc. The definition of these fields, their values, their
        use are fully under local administration control. The peers are unaware of these fields and treat
        the references as single opaque values.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section><name>IPREF Address</name>

      <t>An IPREF address is a combination of a layer 3 network address and a reference carried in the
        same packet. In notation, a plus sign '+' separates the two components. For example:
        198.51.100.11+700 or 2001:db8::abc:11+700.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section><name>Embedding References in IP Packets</name>

      <t>A reference is a network layer entity and the most natural place for embedding it would
         be a network layer header, such as an IPv4 option or an IPv6 extension header.
      </t>
      <t>Unfortunately, many Internet Service Providers drop options and extensions headers for
         various reasons. Even if they don't, network devices tend to put them on a slow processing
         path resulting in poor performance. For that reason, the most reliable way to embed
         references is to place them in the payload. One such common technique is tunneling where
         a reference could be placed in the payload along with the network packet being tunneled.
      </t>

      <section><name>IPv4 Option</name>
        <t>With IPv4, references may be embedded in an IPv4 header option <xref target="RFC791"/>.
           It would be a new option type. It would contain an octet with option type and option
           number, an octet with length, and two octets reserved for possible future use while
           padding to four octet boundary. The source and destination references would then follow.
        </t>
        <t>A new option number would be registered with IANA. Until then, experimental option, 30,
           could be used. A separate document should describe it in detail.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section><name>IPv6 Extension Header</name>
        <t>With IPv6, references may be embedded in an IPv6 extension header <xref target="RFC8200"/>.
           It would be a new header type. It would contain an octet with next header type value,
           an octet with length, and two octets reserved for possible future use. This would be
           followed by four octets of padding to 8 octet boundary. Padding octets would not be
           intended for any future use. The source and destination references would then follow.
        </t>
        <t>A new protocol type would be registered with IANA. Until then, experimental protocol,
           254, could be used. A separate document should describe it in detail.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section><name>UDP Tunnel</name>
        <t>Placing references in a UDP tunnel works for both IPv4 and IPv6. In both cases, the
           references are embedded in the form of respective option or extension header. In
           addition, a tunnel encapsulation record is added. The order of items is as follows:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="compact" empty="true">
          <li>UDP header</li>
          <li>Tunnel encapsulation record</li>
          <li>IPREF option</li>
          <li>Packet payload</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The encapsulation record would consist of four octets. First octet would contain the
           value of TTL copied from the original IP header. The second octet would contain protocol
           number copied from the original IPv4 header or next header value form an IPv6 extension
           header. The third octet would report number of hops detected for incoming packets. The
           fourth octet would be reserved for possible future use while padding to 4 octet boundary.
           The IPREF option would follow in the format matching respective IP protocol, IPv4 or IPv6.
        </t>
        <t>The tunnel would operate at port 1045. This value would be registered with IANA. A
           separate document should describe the tunnel in detail.
        </t>
      </section>

    </section>  <!-- ^^Embedding References^^ -->

    <section><name>Distributing IPREF Addresses</name>

      <t>IPREF addresses can be distributed via DNS <xref target="RFC1035"/> or possibly via other
        name resolution systems. In this document only the case of DNS is described.
      </t>
      <t>IPREF addresses are unlike well known IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. These addresses consist
        of two components which must be considered as a single address entity. It is not possibly to
        separate references from their related <em>third</em> network IP addresses. For that reason, there
        is a need for a new type of a resource record.
      </t>

      <section><name>DNS Records</name>
        <t>IPREF addresses are published using new resource record tentatively called AA. This record
          type has not been registered yet. Until such time, a TXT record may be used. The TXT record
          simply holds a textual representation of an AA record.
        </t>
        <t> Here are some examples of what the records might look like:
        </t>

        <sourcecode type="dns-rr"> <![CDATA[
    Host-B4     AA      198.51.100.22 + 400
    Host-A5     AA      net-A + 500
    Host-A5     AA      2001:db8::abc:11 + 700
    Host-A5     TXT     "AA net-A + 500"
        ]]> </sourcecode>

        <t>The IP portion may be provided numerically or as a domain name. The format for the reference
          would allow unsigned decimal integers as well as unsigned hex integers. Other formats maybe be
          defined as well.
        </t>
        <t>The definition of the new resource record, its use, notation, and registration with IANA should
          be described in a separate document.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section><name>Local Network Resolver</name>
        <t>Local network resolver must provide capability to replace IPREF addresses with IP addresses from
         <em>encoded</em> network in consultation with IPREF mappers. It's not clear if the details may be left
         to implementations or whether some sort of an exchange protocol needs to be defined. If so, a
         separate document would describe it.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section><name>DNS Agent</name>
        <t>A DNS Agent is a component of IPREF mappers that detects if any local hosts are advertised
          as reachable via IPREF addresses. There is a number of existing mechanisms to accomplish this.
          There is probably no need to define another one. In case, there is some reason for doing so, it
          would be described in a separate document.
        </t>
      </section>

    </section>  <!-- ^^Distributing IPREF Addresses^^ -->

    <section><name>Related Technologies</name>

      <t>IPREF works well with related technologies. It does not create conflicts and it does
        not attempt to step on their functionality. 
      </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>IPv4 - IPREF does not replace IPv4, it is an optional add-on to enhance IPv4
             capabilities in the area of address rewriting. It relies on IPv4 in all other
             functions of a network protocol.
          </li>
          <li>IPv6 - IPREF does not replace IPv6, it is an optional add-on to enhance IPv6
             capabilities in the area of address rewriting. It relies on IPv6 in all other
             functions of a network protocol.
          </li>
          <li>NAT - IPREF is an address rewriting technology but operates differently than NAT. It
             operates exclusively at the network layer. It does not reach to upper layer protocols
             or lower layer protocols. For example, there is no manipulation of TCP/UDP ports. All
             layer 4 ports are carried transparently as-is. IPREF does not conflict with NAT. In a
             common configuration, a NAT gateway connects to the <em>third</em> network without
             any changes. IPREF may operate in parallel to NAT on the same gateway, or it may operate
             on another gateway within the local network 'behind NAT'.
          </li>
          <li>VPN - IPREF deals mostly with addressing. It does not perform typical functions of
             a VPN and it does not replace it. It behaves differently. A typical VPN makes hosts
             of a local network appear as if members of some other local network. Hosts subjected
             to a VPN are managed by that other private networks. This involves a substantial level
             of trust between the two private networks. IPREF does not do any of that. Hosts
             reachable through IPREF are firmly in their respective private networks and remain
             managed by their respective administrators. There may be cases where IPREF may be
             deemed sufficient for a particular purpose but in general IPREF is not a substitute
             for a VPN. IPREF does not conflict with VPNs. A VPN might use IPREF to establish
             a VPN connection.
          </li>
          <li>Firewall - IPREF is not a firewall. While allocation or lack of allocation of references
             to local hosts has the effect of blocking or allowing access to them, blocking policy is
             best vested with a firewall. IPREF mappers deal with address rewriting, they are not packet
             filters. There is no conflict between firewalls and IPREF. Firewalls might need to be made
             aware of IPREF to be effective in their mission.
          </li>
        </ul>
